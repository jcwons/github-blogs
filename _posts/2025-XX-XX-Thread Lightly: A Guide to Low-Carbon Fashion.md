# Thread Lightly: A Guide to Low-Carbon Fashion
After I calculated the carbon footprint of several fashion clients, from small businesses to global brands, I want to share some insights into how the consumer can reduce their impact on the environment when buying new clothes.

I wish there was some magic advices that I can give you, but with most things in sustainability, the answer is nuanced. First, we need to understand the different types of fibres and the process of making clothing. Fibres can be roughly categorised into 3 groups: natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic.

The natural fibres include cotton, linen, wool and hemp. Here, we should distinguish between fibres derived from plants (cotton, linen, hemp) and those derived from animals (wool, alpaca). Later are associated with high carbon emissions while the ones derived from plants are on the lower end of the emission spectrum. Especially, the production of linen has a very low carbon footprint.

Semi-synthetic fibres such as viscose/rayon, bamboo, modal or Lyocell are derived from wood pulp. The pulp is to single out the cellulose in it, which is then later on solidified into a yarn/string. This process usually requires the use of chemicals to break the cellulose. This process can be quite high in carbon emissions. There exists certified approaches to reduce the emissions (Tencell for example) where optimised processes are used to minimise the chemical use. Semi-synthetics are generally quite low towards the lower end on the emission scale, but they have the lowest usage compared to the other two.

Most of the clothes produced are made out of synthetic material simply because it is the cheapest to produce. Synthetic fibres include polyester, elastane/spandex/Lycra, acrylic. These are made by melting plastic and turning it into tiny strings. Besides natural fibres from animals, synthetic fibres have the highest emissions. General advice is to avoid synthetics and shop natural fibres. But when you look at Japanese fast-fashion giant Uniqlo, then you see that they are going strong on polyester with their Airism line for example.

So are synthetics always bad in clothing? Probably not. There are several issues with it such as microplastics from washing it and most importantly the end-of-life treatment. But those are different issues. In this guide, I want to focus on the different approaches of how polyester is used.
* 1) As the main constituent of the clothing: This is for example used for active wear. The polyester is melted and formed into long strings which then are knitted or woven into fabric. Taking full advantage of the attributes of polyester.
* 2) Cotton polyester blend: Cotton fibres are usually around 20-30cm long and are spun together to create a continuous yarn. To save money on fabric, polyester can be added to the mix by shredding polyester plastic and adding it to the cotton fibres. The cotton fibres and the shredded plastic are then spun into yarn which is knitted or woven into fabric.
The Cotton-polyester blend combines two fibres to save money not for functional benefit. The combination is rather dysfunctional. The plastic is smoother than cotton and thus is easier to break free from the spun yarn. This process is called pilling. For a cotton-polyester blend, you can check for pilling by simply rubbing the material against each other. This is quite problematic because it releases plastic. And we already have enough plastic and microplastics in our environment (and bodies).

 There is another way that synthetic fibres are used in combination with natural fibres and that is for stretch. Elastane (also referred to as Spandex or Lycra) is a synthetic material that as the name suggests has elastic attributes. Adding a small amount (often 5% or less) to your cotton can make it more stretchy. Skinny jeans, underwear, and socks, all use elastane for functional benefits.

 Finally, I want to talk about the emissions associated with each step in the manufacturing process and what actually are the steps

 1) Production of the fibre (Synthetics requires oil/plastic and energy for melting. Natural fibres requires water and land to grow and also electricity for spinning. Semi-synthetics requires wood and chemicals.)
 1.1) Transport of the fibre to next facility
 2) The fibre is turned into a yarn and the yarn is knitted/woven into fabric. These often happen in the same facility
 2.1) Transport of the fabric to the manufacturer
 3) The fabric is cut and sewn into the final product.
 4) Dyeing, bleaching and printing: Colours or prints are added to the product. This can happen either at the final stage or dyeing can already happen at the yarn/fabric stage.
 5) Transport from manufacturer to warehouse
 6) Transport to from warehouse to store or to customer if online

There is a lot of transport involved in the whole process as fibre production, fabric production, sewing and sale are generally in all in different locations.

That's enough with the lesson. If you have the financial means, the solution for sewstainability (go it? sewing + sustainability) is the same as for everything. 
1) Reduce: Only buy what you need. Try to buy higher quality (avoid cotton-poly blends) that will last longer.
2) Reuse / Upcycle: Have a look at second-hand stores
3) Buy lower impact clothing by looking for organic clothing or recycled synthetics
4) Think about the end-of-life of your product. Donate undamaged unused clothes.
