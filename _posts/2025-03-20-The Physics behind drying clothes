## Introduction
Ever wondered how your washed clothes are drying and why water evaporates at temperatures way below 100°C? If yes, then you are in the right place because I will explain the physics behind these effects.

To answer these questions, we need to understand what temperature is. Then, with some basic physics concepts, we are equipped to answer these questions and more.

Let's start with temperature. When we say that the temperature in a room is 20°C this means the particles in the air have a certain amount of kinetic energy, or in other words, they move at a certain speed. This way of describing temperature is called the kinetic theory of gases in which many attributes of the air can be derived by looking at the gas particles in the air. 

So coming back to the temperature, for simplicity, we assume that our room is only filled with 1 type of gas, let's say oxygen. The speed at which the oxygen moves around determines the temperature of the particles. The particles inside the room are constantly bouncing off each other and exchanging energy. Some particles will be fast and some will be slower. If the particles are left alone for some time, they establish an equilibrium where their energy distribution follows what we call the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as shown below. The temperature of the gas is then related to the most common speed/energy of the particles.

What is going to be important for the evaporation of water is that for a given temperature, there are very few high-energy particles. The distribution function is small, but not zero at high energies. If we now turn to our shirts that are drying by releasing water into the surrounding air, we can understand why they dry at everyday temperatures. If the water particles in the shirt have a high enough energy, then they can break free from the shirt and escape into the air. I highlighted in red the escape energy required for the water particles in the shirt to escape. Even at 20°C, some particles have enough energy to escape.

Because the particles that can escape the shirt are high-energy particles, the temperature of the shirt will drop. The particles inside the shirt will bounce off each other and redistribute the energy arriving at a similar Maxwell distribution, but this time of lower energy. Important at this point is that the number of particles above the escape velocity has now greatly reduced. We already learnt two things:
1) The evaporation rate is higher at higher temperatures.
2) Clothing (and all other items) will cool down during the evaporation process.

Let's look at the temperature of the shirt while drying in a bit more detail. We learned that the temperature drops whenever water evaporates from the shirt. If we only consider this effect, our shirt would lose energy non-stop and the temperature of the shirt would constantly drop. However, the surrounding air is trying to keep the shirt at the ambient temperature (in our case 20degrees C). The temperature of the shirt stabilises at the point where the energy lost from evaporation and the energy received from the surrounding air equalises. As a result, the drying shirt is always colder than its surrounding energy.

Two fun facts about this last effect: 
* This is also how sweat cools us down by evaporating it lowers the energy of our body.
* If you ever hang your clothes in winter and return in the evening, it is a challenge to figure out if your clothes are cold or damp and cold. To figure out if they are dry or not, you can hold them against your cheek (which hopefully is still warm). If the shirt is dry, it will quickly reach the temperature of your cheek. If the shirt is still damp, as learned, the temperature of the shirt will have a temperature lower than your cheek as it is still drying.

Now that we have some understanding of the drying of clothes, we can look at the process in more detail. In particular, we want to understand what other factors besides temperature affect the drying process. Roughly speaking there are 3 effects at play:
1) The speed at which water evaporates from the shirt. This depends on the temperature and energy that the surrounding provides. The Sun can speed up the process by providing additional energy
2) The speed at which water vapour gets transported away from the shirt after has evaporated. This mainly depends on the level of humidity in the ambient air and wind.
3) The movement of water inside the shirt. Water evaporates only on the surface of the shirt that is exposed to air. Depending on the  material and thickness of the shirt, it takes longer for water from the centre to reach the surface.

We don't have much control over the third effect, so we use simplifying assumptions (as physicists love to do). We assume that the shirt is very thin and basically all the water sits at the surface ready to evaporate at any time.

So, I ran a couple of simulations to get some visualisation of what happens when clothing dries. But essentially, it is what is described in step 1) and 2). Water enters the air by evaporating from the shirt increasing the amount of water vapour in the air right next to the shirt. Through diffusion, the random movement of particles in air, the water vapour gets transported away from the shirt. Diffusion moves water from places with higher concentration of water to places of lower concentration. In our case, the closer we are to the shirt, the higher the concentration is. So the shirt keeps on pumping water in to the ambient which gets transported away. The amount of water in the air will be the highest right next to the shirt and drops off. This is shown in the picture below (MAYBE)

Now there is one big limiting factor in this whole process which is the relative humidity, or more accurately, the fact that water can only hold a certain amount of water before it gets saturated and can't take anymore air. Relative humidity describes how close to fully saturated the air is with 100% being fully saturated and 0% no water present.

If the air around the shirt reaches 100% relative humidity than no more water can evaporate from the shirt. We have to wait for the water vapour in the air to move away from the shirt via diffusion. This effect is shown in the animation below. At first, the water is evaporating at a faster speed. Until the surrounding air reaches 100% relative humidity. At this point, the evaporation speed slows down as we have to wait for water in the surrounding air is diffused away. In other words, the speed of our drying process is limited by the diffusion speed. 

A couple of insights and additional informatoin:
* The speed of diffusion speed depends on the temperature of the gas, but also at the relative humidity.
* You can think of wind as an increase in diffusion speed. The wind helps carrying the wet air away from the shirt. If you hang your shirt in front of a fan, the surrounding air will basically always have the ambient relative humidity and is not holding back evaporation.
* It is not always the case that the diffusion speed is smaller than the evaporation speed. In this case, increasing the evaporation speed (heating the shirt) will speed up the drying process.

So let's close this with a couple of insights and facts about drying your clothes:
* On this website (https://www.conservationphysics.org/wetstuff/wetstuff01.html), you can find a cool experiment on drying clothes (It is a good verification of the insights I derived theoretically)
* The reason why clothes shrink in the dryer is because they dry too much. Even when "dry", the fibre in our clothes have some moisture left in them. This is higher for wool than for cotton, that is why wool is a no-no for the dryer. The dryer forces the clothes to dry out beyond that causing damage to the fibre. If the dryer were to stop exactly when the clothes are dry there would be no damage. But this is difficult because different items take different times to dry.

* Sometimes, the fastest way to dry your clothes is by wearing it because your body provides a lot of energy speeding up the evaporation process (emergency solution if you need to dry something fast before a flight)
* If you are unable to dry your swimmers before packing them chlorined pool water keeps them from smelling
